Pulse Width Modulation, PWM, allows the application of analogue behaviours to digital devices. Rather than turning an LED on or off, it's brightness can be controlled.

This code requires an LED with the long (+ve) led attached to GP15, or pin 20, which is the bottom left pin in the USB connector is pointing away from you.
